        "disease that affects the hair follicle and sometimes the nails, has not\n",
        "yet been fully understood. Besides the genetic background, nonspecific immune response, organ-specific autoimmune reactions,\n",
        "and environmental factors are among the most frequently discussed\n",
        "issues in the pathogenesis of this disease [1].\n",
        "It has long been claimed that AA is a psychosomatic disease\n",
        "triggered by stressful life events [2]. In a study investigating\n",
        "comorbid diseases in patients with AA, prevalence of depression\n",
        "and anxiety was found to be high (25.5%) in an 11-year period [3].\n",
        "On the other hand, depression may be present before AA [4].\n",
        "Family problems, work-related problems, and mourning have\n",
        "also been reported by AA patients [4]. It has been suggested that\n",
        "neuroendocrine immunology as well as psychosocial factors may\n",
        "be responsible for the association between AA and depression [5].\n",
        "It is well known that sleep has important effects on immunity.\n",
        "There is evidence of a relationship between sleep disorders and\n",
        "autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing\n",
        "spondylitis, Sjögren’s syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus\n",
        "[6]. It has been reported that patients with sleep disorders, especially\n",
        "young people, had an increased risk of AA [7]. In the same study,\n",
        "sleep disorders were also associated with other autoimmunity\n",
        "related diseases such as Graves’ disease, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis,\n",
        "vitiligo and rheumatoid arthritis.\n",
        "Alopecia areata may occur in different clinical types. In the most\n",
        "common type, there is hair loss in the scalp[8]. If all of the scalp\n",
        "hair is involved, it is called alopecia totalis and, if all of the body\n",
        "hair is involved, it is called alopecia universalis. In the ophiasis\n",
        "type hair loss is seen at the junction of occipital hair line and dermis, and in the reticular type the hair loss is reticular [8].\n",
        "Nail changes are seen in 30% of patients with AA [9]. The most\n",
        "common nail finding is small pits, and the other findings are\n",
        "the Beau line, longitudinal line, koilonychia, onychorhexis,\n",
        "onychomadesis, leukonychia, red-staine lunula, and other nail\n",
        "defects can [9]. It has been suggested that nail change is related to\n",
        "the severity of the disease and indicates possible resistance [10].\n",
        "It is hard to predict natural course in alopecia areata. In some\n",
        "patients, hair completely reappears, in some others, some\n",
        "improvement in AA occurs, and, in still others, the hair loss further\n",
        "increases [11]. Poor prognostic criteria include presence of atopia,\n",
        "extensive involvement, family history, onychodystrophy, presence\n",

The first one work stage working on a project ‑ development structures markup and its features basic implementation in the TEI language that follows the syntax language rules XML markup that makes documents TEI compliant with software features software resources creation and processing and publications xml files. Any one the TEI document consists of it consists of two parts: TEI header, which one is in compliance with the with the principles TEI allows you to encode metadata source code: description publications/manuscripts, name, first name author, language text, information about encoding, changes and etc., and text the module that contains marked text information based on the genre of the text markup the text of the story or it will be different from marking letters must contain additional metadata (recipient, date and place of writing, date, etc.). With using language TEIs can be marked up named fields entities: name, place name, organizations etc., - and also conducted semantic feature markup biographical information information, some social networks categories. such as your profession, social status, etc. This approach allows you to organizations semantic analysis search for a variety of information information for the Humanities researcher, including the one that in the usual way presentation it is being processed in the form of comments, notes and links. Like this thus, the digital publication format reflects the option interpretations texts that have been completed researchers and editors publications [Bonch-Osmolovskaya, 2016, p. 1607].\n",

        "Preparation scientific digital editions are enough difficult task, requiring usage various digital ones tools. At the moment developed by structure markup with building on the work researchers of literary studies, conducted by clarification and bid adjustment markup with using the following parameters: computer programs methods. Provisional framework annotations text corpora a writer with using elements TEI/XML includes markup of the following entities: names and titles; dates and times year; colors; properties and States and events; natural phenomena; social status; profession; animals / plants; comments; notes. For more information we have investigated the first three volumes PSS using theme-based simulations [Korshunov, 2012] ‑ the approach that automatically allows you to identify topics in the data. Conducting research with various options settings automatic theme selections allowed select a topic, which is when different settings always turned it on includes words \"human\", \"time\", \"love\" and \"face\". We investigated usage these words in the under consideration text editor with the use of computer programs technologies (used corpus Manager Voyant Tools (https://voyant-tools.org/)) and identified, what for the word \"time\" is characteristic usage with the verb and articulate nouns: time to joke, time to talk; time of existence, time of absence, what does it indicate if necessary accounting for various special aspects temporalities Chekhov's books texts are not allowed only verbal ones external descriptions characteristics time (objective natural reality), but also psychological aspects subjective experiences it's a matter of time. Therefore category \"seasons of the year\" we have replaced to a wider audience category \"time\".\n",

At that time same time notes and comments to individual users to the texts we use include in text markup - partially in metadata, partially in the form of comments and notes in the text itself. General comments and notes for each volume they should too be enabled in the publication, so we are preparing separate description of each psip volumes.\n",

Like this this approach will allow you to create an ontology texts [see Dikonov, 2012, p. 3.

P. Chekhov, and samo semantic field the entire publication will expand your network for enabling account references and editorial-critical reviews texts coming out outside the scope of the Pssip. In addition, converting to the following format TEI/XML transcriptions manuscripts the writer, their draft versions, editorial offices, copies allows you to carry out additional information reconciliation with the originals, expand the database references materials, source studies and textual data comments / notes.\n",

First of all, in convenience search not only for individual cases words, but also by contexts, by units segmentation options text and their attributes semantic relationships.

For listeners there was a logical result question, are peculiar whether identified features only this one a group of characters. Within the project find an answer it will be possible much faster, than manually. Second, comment it will be linked to the software text link, not in at the end of the book.
